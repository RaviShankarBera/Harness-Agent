# UI Canvas: hand-editable component preview in the browser

Status: implemented (`feat/ui-canvas`), local testing before PR
Lineage: shares its server and protocol with [Plan Canvas](plan-canvas.md), itself inspired by
[lavish-axi](https://github.com/kunchenguid/lavish-axi) by @kunchenguid. Editing conventions
borrow from [VisBug](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/ProjectVisBug) (Adam Argyle,
Apache-2.0: Enter/Shift+Enter tree walking, Delete removes, Alt+Delete-style property stripping)
and [Onlook](https://github.com/onlook-dev/onlook) (Apache-2.0: the design/preview mode split).
No third-party code is vendored; the editor is an original, dependency-free implementation.

## Problem

Checking a visual change today means asking the agent to edit the real component, rebuild,
rerun, and look. A padding tweak costs a full feature cycle, and the feedback is typed
("move the button up a bit") when it would be faster shown. Lovable-style products solve this
with a hosted editor coupled to one framework. ECC needs the same loop for any component, any
harness, and nothing heavier than a loopback server.

## What it is

The agent writes one self-contained `.html` mockup. `ecc-ui-canvas open <file>` shows it in a
browser shell where the human:

- clicks to select (hover and selection outlines, size badge), double-clicks to edit text,
  drags eight handles to resize (images keep ratio unless Shift), drags to reorder among
  siblings or into another container, Alt-drags or arrows to nudge, presses Delete to remove;
- edits style properties from a grouped inspector (size, fill, text, spacing, border, effects)
  with sliders, double-click-to-type values that are sanitized and clamped before they reach
  the mockup, HSL plus alpha color sliders, and a clear button per property;
- switches between desktop (fills the stage), mobile (393×852 with a device frame), and exact
  width × height, rotates, and scales the stage down only when it is too small, so media queries
  behave as in production;
- toggles an interact mode where clicks reach the component, and pauses animations;
- chats with the agent about the selected element while the agent is parked in
  `ecc-ui-canvas await`; the presence pill names the harness that is listening;
- clicks **Apply to file** to have the agent bake the hand edits into the mockup, or
  **Save and Finish** to hand over the final design.

Every change is recorded as a structured edit (`text`, `resize`, `move`, `nudge`, `remove`,
`style`) against a CSS selector. The log is re-applied when the agent's file edit live-reloads
the frame, undone with Cmd/Ctrl+Z, and exported with a clean DOM snapshot to
`<name>.edited.html` and `<name>.edits.json` next to the artifact. The agent reads those and
reproduces the look in the real component.

## How it fits ECC

| Piece | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CLI entry | `scripts/ui-canvas.js` (npm bin `ecc-ui-canvas`) | A profile over `scripts/plan-canvas.js`: same transport, `mode: ui`, its own usage and next-step guidance |
| Server | `scripts/lib/plan-canvas/server.js` | Mode-aware routes: `/canvas/:key` renders the UI shell, `/artifact/:key/` injects the editor, `/ui-editor.js`, `/ui-client.js`, `/ui-canvas.css`; `edits`/`finish` batches are written to disk before queueing |
| Sessions | `scripts/lib/plan-canvas/sessions.js` | `mode`, `ui` options (viewport, title), `agent` descriptor; UI feedback normalized by `ui-canvas/feedback.js` |
| Feedback schema | `scripts/lib/ui-canvas/feedback.js` | Edit kinds, clamps, summaries, viewport presets, export writer |
| Shell | `scripts/lib/ui-canvas/ui.js` | Top bar, stage with device frame and scaling, inspector, edit log, conversation; ECC design tokens |
| Editor | `scripts/lib/ui-canvas/editor.js` | Script injected into the sandboxed frame; shadow-root overlay, gestures, edit log, restore, export |
| Agent identity | `scripts/lib/plan-canvas/agent-identity.js` | Harness detection from environment markers; `ECC_CANVAS_AGENT` override |
| Hooks | `scripts/hooks/plan-canvas-pending.js`, `plan-canvas-sessions.js` | Understand `edits`/`finish`, name the right bin per session mode |
| Skill | `skills/ui-canvas/SKILL.md` (+ `.agents/skills/ui-canvas/` for Codex) | Mockup rules, feedback shapes, finish handling |
| Command | `commands/ui-canvas.md` | Thin entrypoint |
| Tests | `tests/lib/ui-canvas-*.test.js`, `tests/lib/plan-canvas-agent-identity.test.js`, `tests/scripts/ui-canvas.test.js`, `tests/integration/ui-canvas-e2e.test.js` | Schema, shell/editor contract, server mode, CLI flow |

Registration mirrors plan-canvas: `package.json` (`bin`, `files`), `manifests/install-components.json`
and `install-modules.json` (workflow-quality), `manifests/pi-core.json` exclusions, `agent.yaml`,
`docs/COMMAND-REGISTRY.json`, `COMMANDS-QUICK-REF.md`, `docs/COMMAND-AGENT-MAP.md`.

## Protocol

Shell and editor talk only over `postMessage` (the frame is sandboxed without
`allow-same-origin`, exactly like Plan Canvas, so a hostile mockup cannot reach the loopback API).

Editor → shell: `uc:ready`, `uc:selection` (descriptor, style report, breadcrumb), `uc:edits`
(log plus undo/redo availability), `uc:status`, `uc:toggle-mode`, `uc:scroll`, `uc:export`.
Shell → editor: `uc:set-mode`, `uc:restore` (edits, scroll, selection after a reload),
`uc:select`, `uc:deselect`, `uc:style`, `uc:size`, `uc:remove`, `uc:edit-text`, `uc:undo`,
`uc:redo`, `uc:reset`, `uc:forget`, `uc:pause-animations`, `uc:export`.

Browser → server feedback items (`POST /api/session/:key/feedback`):

- `chat` with optional `anchor` (selected element) and `pendingEdits` (one-line summaries of
  hand edits not yet in the file; context only, never to be applied by the agent);
- `edits` (Apply to file) and `finish` (Save and Finish) with `edits`, `viewport`, and `html`.
  The server writes `html` to `<name>.edited.html`, the log to `<name>.edits.json`, and queues
  the item with `exportPath`/`editsPath` instead of markup. `finish` ends the session.

Agent `await` adds `agent=<descriptor>` so the presence pill reads "Claude Code · listening".

## Responsiveness

The slow path in earlier Plan Canvas sessions was delivery: feedback only reached an agent
parked in `await`, and presence lied while nothing listened. UI Canvas inherits the fixes
(honest presence with expiry, Stop-hook drain, `pending`) and adds: the shell keeps the human's
edits client-side and replays them after every reload, so the agent's file write is the only
work between a chat request and the repaint (file watcher debounce 150 ms, reload, restore).
The skill tells the agent to signal `typing --state thinking` immediately and reply with
`await --reply`.

## Out of scope

- Framework-aware code generation. The export is DOM plus an edit log; translating it into
  React/Vue/Swift is the agent's job, guided by the skill.
- Multi-file apps or remote URLs. One local file per session.
- Pixel-exact device emulation (user agent, touch events, DPR). The viewport is exact in CSS
  pixels; hover and pointer media features follow the real browser.
- Collaborative sessions. One browser, one agent, one file.

## Verification

`node tests/lib/ui-canvas-feedback.test.js`, `node tests/lib/ui-canvas-ui.test.js`,
`node tests/lib/plan-canvas-agent-identity.test.js`, `node tests/scripts/ui-canvas.test.js`,
`node tests/integration/ui-canvas-e2e.test.js`, plus the existing Plan Canvas suites, run under
`node tests/run-all.js`. Manual browser QA uses a mockup opened with
`ECC_PLAN_CANVAS_STATE_DIR=/tmp/uc ECC_PLAN_CANVAS_PORT=4599 node scripts/ui-canvas.js open <file> --no-open`.
